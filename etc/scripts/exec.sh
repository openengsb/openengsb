# Script used to build the entire servicebus and run it. As opposed to
# run.sh this script does not use the maven-goal openengsb:provision to launch
# the openengsb, but rather extracts the release-zip. This way it behaves very
# much like an actual release.

echo "Be careful in using this script. It does neighter run unit tests nor an upgrade!"
