ldif How-To
-----------
How to get an LDAP server ready for the connector:

1) import openengsbSchema.ldif. It seems to make sense if the attribute types already exist when creating the indices.
better restart server. not sure if required but doesn't hurt.
2) import ads-partitionAndIndexes. Takes quite some time (~2 minutes). Please note that this file is rather ApacheDS 
specific. What is important is to have a partition with an id/name "openengsb" and a suffix "dc=openengsb,dc=org".
MUST restart server after step 2.
3) import partitionBasicStructure. Creates basic structure of partition.

IMPORTANT:
Indices must be configured before loading data into the server. Indices configured after loading entries into the server 
will NOT work properly unless they are built using the index builder command supplied with the ApacheDS tools command 
line program.
