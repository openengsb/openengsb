  <title>Security in the OpenEngSB</title>

  <section xml:id="user.security.usermanagement">
    <title>Usermanagement</title>

    <para>The OpenEngSB has a central user management service, which can be used for example by an user interface.
      The service is designed to manage your users. You can create new user and save them to the persistence or retrieve,
      update and delete them. </para>

    <para>The user management needs a back-end database, e.g. the central persistence service of the OpenEngSB.</para>

    <para>
      The interface of the
      <link xlink:href="${github}/core/api/src/main/java/org/openengsb/core/api/security/UserManager.java">User manager</link>
      supports basic CRUD mechanisms (create, retrieve, update, delete).
      The <link xlink:href="${github}/core/api/src/main/java/org/openengsb/core/api/security/model/User.java">User</link>
      is the used user model. It holds attributes like a password, username, if the user is enabled, or his account is expired or locked.
      A user is identified by his username. So the username can not be changed.
      Another attribute are the authorities. These are the roles granted to the user. These can be for example "ROLE_ADMIN" which defines the user as admin.
      Depending on the roles, a user can have different rights. For the OpenEngSB-UI a user has to have at least the role "ROLE_USER" which is the default role.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="user.security.access">
    <title>Access control</title>

    <para>Access control is done on the service level. Core-services and connector-instances are all published as
      OSGi-services. Other services and components always reference these service instances. We use the approach of
      AOP to achieve security of these services. The openengsb.core.security-bundle publishes a service that serves as
      a method-interceptor. When it is attached to a service every method call on the service is preceeded with an
      authorization-check. </para>

    <para>A reference to the method-interceptor can be obtained by this line in the spring-context.xml
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<osgi:reference id="securityInterceptor" interface="org.aopalliance.intercept.MethodInterceptor" />]]></programlisting>
      In order to attach it to an existing bean, one has to create a ProxyFactoryBean:
      <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<bean id="secureServiceManager" class="org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean">
  <property name="proxyInterfaces">
    <value>other.ServiceInterface</value>
  </property>
  <property name="interceptorNames">
    <list>
      <value>securityInterceptor</value>
    </list>
  </property>
  <property name="target" ref="<realBean>" />
</bean>]]></programlisting>
      When registering a service in code rather than in a spring context.xml this can be done as seen in the
      <link xlink:href="${github}/core/common/src/main/java/org/openengsb/core/common/AbstractServiceManager.java">
        AbstractServiceManager</link>
      <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
import org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactory;
//
// ...
//
ProxyFactory factory = new ProxyFactory(serviceObject);
factory.addAdvice(securityInterceptor);
OpenEngSBService securedService = (OpenEngSBService) factory.getProxy();]]></programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>The decision about the allowing the user access to a service as made by looking at the services instanceId.
      Therefore, all services that are to be placed under this access control, must implement
      <link xlink:href="${github}/core/api/src/main/java/org/openengsb/core/api/OpenEngSBService.java">
        OpenEngSBservice</link>, and make sure the instanceId is unique enough to ensure security.
      You may want to derive your service-class from
      <link xlink:href="${github}/core/common/src/main/java/org/openengsb/core/common/AbstractOpenEngSBService.java">
        AbstractOpenEngSBService</link>.</para>
    <para>The persistence of the security-bundle manages a set of GrantedAuthorities (Roles) for each instanceId.
      There is one exception: Users with "ROLE_ADMIN" are always granted access.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Authentication</title>
    <para>This chapter describes how to deal with security in internal bundles and client projects</para>
    <para>For authentication the OpenEngSB provides an AuthenticationProvider as a service. It's obtainable via
      blueprint. <programlisting><![CDATA[
        <reference interface="org.springframework.security.authentication.AuthenticationManager" />]]>
      </programlisting>
      This service is able to authenticate users
      (org.springframework.security.authentication.UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken) and bundles
      (org.openengsb.core.security.BundleAuthenticationToken). The use of the former is pretty obvious. The latter is
      used for authentication for internal actions, that require elevated privilages. This authentication should be
      used with caution, and never be exposed externally for security reasons.</para>
