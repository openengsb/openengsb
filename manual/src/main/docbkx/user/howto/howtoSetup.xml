  <title>HowTo - Setup OpenEngSB for development (First steps)</title>

  <section>
    <title>Goal</title>
      <para>This section describes the setup process required for OpenEngSB development.</para>

      <para>If you would like to view a use-case centric tutorial take a look at the continuous integration example.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Time to Complete</title>
    <para>If you are already familiar with Java EE servers about 15 minutes. We will not be using advanced concepts, so you likely be able to continue with the tutorial even without it.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Prerequisites</title>
    <para>It is assumed you have basic knowledge of system administration and you are able to set up auxiliary software (i.e. JDK 1.6) yourself.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Java Development Kit 6</title>

    <para>First of all the JDK6 should be installed on the system and the JAVA_HOME variable should be set.
  (<link xlink:href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads">Java download</link>).</para>
    <para>Also, make sure that the java-command is available in the PATH-variable.</para>

    <title>Getting OpenEngSB</title>

    <para>Download the latest OpenEngSB release from <link xlink:href="http://openengsb.org/downloads.html">here</link>.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Installing OpenEngSB</title>

    <para>Extract the archive, and run the openengsb-script (bin/openengsb.bat on windows, bin/openengsb otherwise). Click the following link to open the web interface in your browser <link xlink:href="http://localhost:8090/openengsb">http://localhost:8090/openengsb</link>.You should automatically be directed to a page asking for a login. The default login is "admin" with "password" as password.</para>

    <title>Setup required domains</title>

    <para>OpenEngSB implements it's functionality in so called features. Each feature contains a number of OSGi bundles. While all features are distributed with the OpenEngSB not all of them are installed to speed up the startup. For the next section (First Steps) it is required to install additional features. Therefore open the console in which you've started the OpenEngSB and enter "list" which should output something like:</para>

    <para>In order to install domains and connectors from other repositories you need to add the corresponding
      feature-URLs. Note that in order to install a connector you need to install all domains it implements.</para>

    <para>In order to install a domain first add the feature-repository using the command <code>features:addurl</code>.
      When the URL has been added the domain can usually be installed using <code>features:install</code></para>

    <programlisting>
<![CDATA[root@openengsb>features:addurl mvn:org.openengsb.domain/org.openengsb.domain.notification/[domain version]/xml/features

    </programlisting>

    <para>Note that domains and connectors are versioned independently of each other and the OpenEngSB.</para>
