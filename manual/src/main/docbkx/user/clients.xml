  <title>Client Projects and Embedding The OpenEngSB</title>
  <para>
    Although the OpenEngSB is distributed as a binary ZIP it is basically not meant to be used that way. Instead you typically 
    start developing your own project using the OpenEngSB as a base environment and Maven to assembly your code with the OpenEngSB.
  </para>
  <section>
    <title>Using the same dependencies as the OPENENGSB</title>
    <para>To use the same dependencies as the OPENENGSB project you have to import the openengsb-bundle-settings project
      into your dependency management section:</para>
    <programlisting> <![CDATA[
     <dependencyManagement>
       <dependencies>
         <dependency>
           <groupId>org.openengsb.build</groupId>
           <artifactId>openengsb-bundle-settings</artifactId>
           <version>Version of OPENENGSB you use</version>
           <type>pom</type>
           <scope>import</scope>
         </dependency>
       </dependencies>
     </dependencyManagement>
     ]]> </programlisting>
       <para>This will import all the dependencies with the correct versions into the dependencyManagement section.
         You can now define the dependencies shared between your project and OPENENGSB in your dependencies 
         section without setting the version.</para>
