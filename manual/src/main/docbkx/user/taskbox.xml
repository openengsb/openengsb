  <title>Taskbox</title>
  <para>The Taskbox enables you to combine workflows with Human Interactions.</para>
  <section>
    <title>Core Functionality</title>
    <para>All workflows started in the OpenEngSB are supplied with the global variable  
    <link xlink:href="${github}/core/api/src/main/java/org/openengsb/core/api/workflow/model/ProcessBag.java">ProcessBag</link>.
    Inside the workflow you can populate the ProcessBag with your data. As soon as Human Interaction is needed you have to incorporate
    the sub-workflow "humantask", which wraps the ProcessBag into a
    <link xlink:href="${github}/core/api/src/main/java/org/openengsb/core/api/workflow/model/Task.java">Task</link>.
    You can then query the 
    <link xlink:href="${github}/core/api/src/main/java/org/openengsb/core/api/workflow/TaskboxService.java">Taskbox service</link>
    for open Tasks, and manipulate the data inside of the Task (Not necessarily by Human Interaction). When you are finished, 
    you again call the Taskbox service and supply the changed Task. The changed data gets extracted and is handed back over to the workflow.
    </para>

  <section>
    <title>UI Functionality</title>
    <para>The
    <link xlink:href="${github}/ui/common/wicket/src/main/java/org/openengsb/ui/common/wicket/taskbox/WebTaskboxService.java">Webtaskbox service</link>
    provides additional UI Features, if you want to integrate the Taskbox-Concept into a wicket Page. You can query the Webtaskbox service for an    
    <link xlink:href="${github}/ui/common/wicket/src/main/java/org/openengsb/ui/common/wicket/taskbox/web/TaskOverviewPanel.java">Overview Panel</link>
    that displays all open Tasks. If the default Overview Panel doesn't fit your needs exactly you can develop your own UI-Component using the (Core-)Taskboxservice.
    If you navigate onto a specific Task the Overview Panel displays a (default)
    <link xlink:href="${github}/ui/common/wicket/src/main/java/org/openengsb/ui/common/wicket/taskbox/web/TaskPanel.java">Detail Panel</link>
    populated with the values of the Task, if there is no custom Panel registered for the supplied tasktype.
    You can develop your own Detail-Panels and register them for a specific Tasktype via the Webtaskbox service.
