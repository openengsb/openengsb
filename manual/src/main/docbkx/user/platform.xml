    <title>OpenEngSB Platform</title>

    <para>The aim of the OpenEngSB project, as for every open source project, is to make the life of everyone better.
    Or at least the life of engineers :). With that said, we want to support projects using the OpenEngSB as base 
    environment, or
    providing domains and connectors. While it is easy to find a source repository and use the OpenEngSB (because
    of its business friendly Apache 2 license), it is not that easy to get the visibility your project earns. We want
    to provide you with this visibility by including your project into the OpenEngSB product family. Basically we 
    provide you with the following infrastructure:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>Sub domain within the OpenEngSB: yourproject.openengsb.org</listitem>
      <listitem>Upload space for a homepage at yourproject.openengsb.org</listitem>
      <listitem>Two mailinglists (yourproject-dev@openengsb.org and yourproject-user@openengsb.org)</listitem>
      <listitem>A git repository at github.com/openengsb/yourpoject</listitem>
      <listitem>A place at our issue tracker</listitem>
      <listitem>A place at our build server</listitem>
    </itemizedlist> 

    <para>To get your project on the infrastructure you have to use the Apache 2 license for your code and use the
    OpenEngSB. It is not required to have any existing source base. Simply send your project proposal to the
    openengsb-dev mailing list and we'll discuss your project. Don't be afraid; it's not as hard as it sounds ;)</para>
