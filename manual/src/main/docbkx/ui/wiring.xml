  <title>Wiring</title>

  <para>This user interface constitutes a way for administrators to do wiring. 
    Wiring is a process, where global variables get connected with connectors (domain endpoints) 
    in a certain context. As there are several steps to do that, this page gives you a fast  
    and easy managing possibility. For further reading, please visit

        <para>Select a domain-type in the drop-down-field. Doing that, all domain endpoints and all 
          globals of this domain-type will be loaded. If nothing appears, then there will be probably no 
          suitable global available and no suitable connector is instantiated. This can be checked on the

        <para>You have to choose a global, because that is the object you want to get wired with a connector.
          A global variable is part of a rule allowing the workflow service to communicate with connectors 
          and other objects. More information you can find in the Chapter about

        <para>
          There are two possibilities to specify a global. Either you select one from the list or you write 
          autonomous a name of a global in the corresponding text field. If the global doesn't exist, there 
          will be a new one created with the type of the selected domain. If a global already exists and have 
          another type as selected, then there will be an error message after submitting.

    <para>The properties of the service will be updated. First, it will try to get the property with the key 
      'location.' + context from these properties, because there are all locations stored. If there is no such 
      property, a new one will be added. After that, it will insert a new location in that property, which is the 
      name of the given global. As there can be more locations, the new one will be appended excepted such 
      location already exists. Then nothing will be changed, but an info message will appear.
