  <title>Recommended Eclipse Plug-ins for Developers</title>

  <para>The following plug-ins for Eclipse are recommended for the development of the OpenEngSB.
  If not otherwise stated we recommend the latest stable version of the plug-ins. For information about
  the basic setup of this plug-ins please take a look into the corresponding plug-in documentation. This 
  section only gives hints for setup if it is OpenEngSB specific.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Properties Editor</title>
    <para>The <link xlink:href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/properties-editor-0">properties editor</link> 
    can be used to edit the properties files used for internationalization and automatically escapes special characters,
    like the German "Ã¼".</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Rinzo XML Editor</title>
    <para><link xlink:href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/rinzo-xml-editor">Rinzo XML Editor</link> 
    adds support for full XML editing including Java File completion and renaming to the Eclipse platform. 
    Since SpringIDE is no longer an option (because of blueprint) Rinzo XML is a good alternative for
    SpringIDE in the context of the OpenEngSB.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Eclemma code coverage</title>
    <para>At the OpenEngSB project we're trying to keep test density as high as possible. To check the coverage
    of code written locally we recommend <link xlink:href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclemma-java-code-coverage">Eclemma</link> 
    as a free and OpenSource Eclipse plugin.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Eclipse M2 Plugin</title>
    <para>The <link xlink:href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/maven-integration-eclipse">M2 Eclipse Plugin</link> 
    adds Maven support directly to your platform. Though, please still use openengsb:eclipse instead of this plugin
    if you're generating the .project, .classpath and .settings files. We recommend you this plugin since it helps a
    great deal with editing pom files, but for NO other use.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Egit Eclipse Plugin</title>
    <para><link xlink:href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/egit-git-team-provider">Egit Eclipse Plugin</link> 
    adds Git support to your Eclipse IDE. Though, we do not reccomend commiting/pulling via the IDE, but rather via
    the CMD and use the IDE as a visual indicator for changed files</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Eclipse CS</title>
    <para>The <link xlink:href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/checkstyle-plug">checkstyle plugin</link> 
    integrates checkstyle into Eclipse. Conformance with checkstyle criteria has to be checked before each push to 
    the repository, so integrating the check into the IDE helps developers to already conform to the checkstyle 
    criteria during development. You have to configure the plug-in to use our checkstyle configuration file, which
    can be found <link xlink:href="${checkstyleconfig}">here</link>
    </para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Drools</title>
    <para>The <link xlink:href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/jboss-drools">Drools plug-in</link> is handy
    if you want to edit workflows or Drools rules, because it provides syntax highlighting for rules and a graphical
    editor for workflows.</para>
