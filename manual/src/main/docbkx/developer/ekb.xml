    <title>Engineering Knowledge Base - EKB</title>
    <para>
        The EKB, as it is now, is at the very beginning of its development, so there is not much to write here for now.
        The most important thing which is provided by the EKB at the moment is the QueryService.
    </para>
    
    <section>
        <title>Motivation</title>
        <para>
            The main idea for the introduction of the EKB was the idea to provide automatic transformations of domain models
            between tools and the OpenEngSB. But soon it was clear that this will not the only task the EKB should provide.
        </para>
        <para>
            Some other things the EKB shall provide when it is finished will be the QueryInterface service which represents
            the loading force of models from the EDB (this is already implemented), the possibility to provide better conflict
            checkers for the EDB and if possible automatic conflict solving.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Query Service</title>
        <para>
            This service, which is already provided by the EKB bundle, has the task to load models from the EDB for
            the user and transform the so got data from the EDB directly in an OpenEngSBModel so that the user can
            start his work with the models without taking notice of the transformations of EDB data to
            models.
        </para>
        <para>
            The query service provide a list of possibilities how to load models from the EDB (e.g. based on the model id or
            based on the key value pairs of the model).
