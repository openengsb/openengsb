    <title>How to add new field support for domain models</title>

    <section>
        <title>Goal</title>
        <para>
            This tutorial explains how to create new supported field types for domain models. The support is only needed if you
            want to save and load this type into/from the EDB. What a domain model is can be read in the user manual in the semantics
            section(<xref linkend="user.semantics" />). In that section is also explained which fields are currently supported.

            If you are already familiar with the OpenEngSB the first subtask will take about 45 minutes. In the case you are not familiar 
            with the OpenEngSB please read this manual from the start or check the <link xlink:href="http://www.openengsb.org">homepage
            </link> for further information.

        <title>Subtask 1 - Enable saving of the type</title>
        <para>
            The class which needs to be edited in both subtasks is the EDBConverter class in the EKB bundle. WARNING: This step 
            is currently under construction and very likely to be changed soon.
        </para>
        <para>
            Here you need to add a new else if block to the method convertSubModel. Examples how to do that are already implemented.
        </para>

    <section>
        <title>Subtask 2 - Enable loading of the type</title>
        <para>
            To accomplish this task, you have to extend the EDBConverter class in the EKB bundle. WARNING: This step is currently 
            under construction and very likely to be changed soon.
        </para>
        <para>
            Here you need to add a new else if block to the method getValueForProperty. Examples how to do that are already implemented.
