  <title>External Domains and Connectors</title>

  <para>Since tools are mostly neither developed for the OpenEngSB nor written in any way that they can be directly
    deployed in the OpenEngSB environment a way is required to connect via different programming languages than Java
    and from multiple protocols.</para>

      <title>Proxying internal Connector calls</title>
      <para>The proxy mechanism allows to create proxies for any domain. To create a proxy you have to provide a
        port id, destination and service id to call on the remote service. A Port encapsulates the protocol that
        is used to call another service. There are an OutgoingPort and IncomingPort interface for respective purposes.
        The port id is used to load the Port via OSGi. To include a Port in OPENENGSB it just has to be exported via OSGi.
        The destination is a string that has to be correctly interpreted by the port to call the remote server.
        The service id is added as metadata do identify the service that should get called on the remote server. It may not
        be needed for certain implementations.</para>
      <para>The proxy calls the CallRouter which redirects the methodcall to the respective Port. Security is implemented
        in this layer.</para>
