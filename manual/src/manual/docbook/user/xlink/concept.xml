    <title>General Concept of XLink</title>
    <para>This section introduces a concept to enable crossprogram linking in integrated frameworks
        with, so called, XLinks. It highlights the required precodintions, the contained logical and
        architectual components and the sequence of nessecary actions undertaken by the users and
        the components to establish crossprogram linking. Crossprogram linking supports actors who
        work on different, but semantically related, sets of data. In most cases this will occur
        during cooperations of actors from different disciplines. We will start with a general
        description of the concept and go further into details concerning the implementation into
        the OpenEngSB framework as we proceed.</para>
    <section xml:id="concept.assumptions">
        <title>Preconditions and Assumptions</title>
        <para>The most basic assumption is that data, which is used during everyday work, is
            organized in projects and are therefore loosely semantically related. Every project may
            consist of a variety of artifacts with different content and datatypes. Actors from
            various disciplines are working together on different projects, everyone with their
            appropriate set of tools alias programs. A tool is connected to the OpenEngSB via a
            connector. It may offer different kinds of views on the data it is working on, but it
            serves a certain general purpose. Bigger tools which serve multiple purposes may have
            multiple connectors and are, in the following section, treated as a suite of standalone
            tools, every single one with its own purpose. Therefore it is assumed that tools work on
            data with a similar or related structure. An actor may hold the whole dataset of a
            project or just subset of it, for a graphical description see <link
                linkend="concept.graphic">here</link>.</para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="concept.logical.components">
        <title>Components in General</title>
        <para>In most cases tools work on structured data and use defined <emphasis role="bold"
                >models</emphasis> to manage it. In OpenEngSB, every defined model is part of a
                <link xlink:href="#architecture.concept.tooldomains">Domain</link>. Tools work
            against those Domains and implement the associated models. To enable linking across
            models, we have to add additional metadata to those models. For a model we define an
            appropriate <emphasis role="bold">identifier</emphasis>, it is now refered to as
            'linkable'. In that way, data which is represented by a model, is parted through the
            model´s identifier, into instances of the model, called <emphasis role="bold"
                >modelobjects</emphasis>. The identifier of a model has to ensure, that each
            modelobject is unique within the model. The structure of the identifier of a model also
            defines the precision in which points of interest in the content can be addressed. Since
            a datastructure may originate from another one, models may be nested in each other. A
            link to a modelobject can now be established by its identifier. Such link must be of the
            structure <emphasis role="bold">Context.Model.Version.Identifier</emphasis>. The
            'version' part of the link, represents the version of the model the identifier was
            created in.</para>
        <example>
            <title>An Example</title>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">A programmer is working on a project. Part of the
                    project´s data is java sourcecode. The programmer is working on the project with
                    a java sourcecode editor. Now we define a model called 'OOSourecode'. As
                    identifier we define a string with the structure 'package.classname.methodname'.
                    This string is unique within the java sourcecode but also within every other
                    object-oriented sourcecode. Therefore the java sourcecode editor is associated
                    with the model 'OOSourecode' in the registry. The viewed sourcecode is now
                    splitted (semantically) into modelobjects, each modelobject representing a
                    single method within the sourcecode. Imagine the developer implements a
                    webservice, both in Java and C++. Every method in each implementation is
                    represented as a modelobject. Between the two implementations, some modelobjects
                    are having a strong semantic realtion, since they are implementations to the
                    same webservice. A developer would be able to jump between those corresponding
                    methods.</emphasis></para>
        </example>
        <para>Every tool organizes data in its own way and may offer different views on it´s data.
            The enviroment in which this is done is called the <emphasis role="bold"
                >toolenviroment</emphasis>. This toolenviroment can be imagined as a set of
            key/value pairs, managed by the tool. The tool also implements some OpenEndSB models,
            the ones associated with its Domain. Therefore the Tool knows which models are linkable
            and can decide which ones can be connected with it´s toolenviroment. To participate in
            crossprogram linking, a tool must announce it´s participation at the OpenEngSB and
            declare the models (inclusive  the views per model) it is able to use for XLink. Some of
            those declared models are choosen by the OpenEngSB to be used for the XLink process. The
            tool receives a <emphasis role="bold">XLinkTemplate</emphasis> with information (will be
            discussed below). After this registration, every tool must be able to receive and open
            or to retrieve modelobjects of the models it has declared.</para>
        <para>Now, to enable distributed linking between semantically related datapoints, an
            (abstract) central component, called <emphasis role="bold">xlink-registry</emphasis>, is
            needed. It manages the association of models to connectors (e.g. tools) and the
                <emphasis role="bold">mapping</emphasis> between modelobjects from different models.
            The nessecary tasks fulfilled by this registry will be provided by the <link
                xlink:href="#contributor.ekb">engineering knowledge base</link> (ekb). A mapping is
            achieved by <emphasis role="bold">transformation</emphasis> of a modelobject from the
            format of the source-model to the format of the destination-model. How the
            transformation between the various models is done, is explained <link
                xlink:href="#xlink.openengsb.model.transformation">here</link>. The first two
            required inputs to calculate such a mapping, are the source-model and a modelobject from
            the source-model, represented by an identifier as shown above. The third required input
            is the destination-model. The generated output is a set of identifiers in the
            destination-model´s structure. They represent <emphasis role="bold">potential
                matches</emphasis> to modelobjects which are associated with the destination-model.
            If the generated identifiers correspond to some real modelobjects a match was found and
            a link between different datapoints was made. It may occur that no corresponding real
            modelobject can be found and linking fails. Depending on the quality of the
            transformation, the quality of the structured data and the degree of semantical relation
            a match is more likely to be found, or not. For example, crossproject linking may
            technically be realised but wont be very effective since the different datasets may be
            not semantical related at all. It is also possible that there is no possible
            transformation between two models and no match can be generated at all. Because of the
            different granularity and characteristics of identifiers, one modelobject of a model may
            be associated with multiple modelobjects of another model. <anchor

        <para>Actors want to share <emphasis role="bold">XLinks</emphasis> of modelobjects via
            channels like email, when they want to highlight points of interest for other actors.
            When an actor receives a XLinks to a modelobject, he wants to open corresponding
            datapoints in his tools and datasets. To make those XLinks easy to call from a wide
            range of programs, they are realized as URLs that points to the registry. The identifier
            which links to the corresponding modelobject is added as a set of GET-Parameters. For
            example:
            <ns:programlisting><![CDATA[http://urlToRegistry.suff?identifier-field1=someData&amp;identifier-field2=someData]]>           </ns:programlisting>The
            OpenEngSB is able to receive such http-requests and act on them. Since the dataset of
            projects is changed frequently, generated XLinks will expire after a few days. This
            predicates on the fact that possible matches of generated XLinks will be less likely the
            more the dataset has changed since its generation. Therefore XLinks are not to be used
            in wikis or documentation.</para>
        <para>As mentioned, the xlink-registry must act as a central component to all tools and must
            therefore be providing a connection on this XLink-URL the whole time to enable linking.
            Tools may be up and running or not, they may connect and disconnect at any time. When an
            actor starts his client, his installed tools must notify the xlink-registry if they want
            to participate in linking. During a notification, the tool must provide it´s host´s IP
            (this will be explained later on) and a Map of linkable models and views it is
            accepting. For every view of the tool, the xlink-registry chooses the most appropriate
            model (see the Registrationfunction <link xlink:href="#implementation.registration"
                >implementation</link>). This means that for every view, the tool must adopt the
            identfier of a given model. To create valid XLinks, the tool also needs the registry-url
            and the correct OpenEngSB context of the Xlink. All this information will be returned to
            the tool via a <emphasis role="bold">XLinkTemplate</emphasis>, containing the <emphasis
                role="bold">registry-url</emphasis>, a <emphasis role="bold">map of views with
                associated models</emphasis>, the ContextId keyname and some additional information
            for Local Switching (this will be explained later on). Note that the registry-url is
            already prefilled with some mandatory metadata that does not change during the session.
            The transported map instructs the tool which models to use and expect for certain views.
            In this way a tool can fetch the data, necessary to identify a modelobject, dynamically
            by the instructions in the XLinkTemplate (see the attributes of the XLinkTemplate <link
                xlink:href="#implementation.xlinkemplate.attributes">implementation</link> and see
            how an XLinkTemplate is <link xlink:href="#implementation.xlinkemplate.prepareUseCase"
                >prepared</link> bevor transmission). The tool must construct valid XLink URLs by
            adding the identifying fields of the model of the given view, the modelclass and version
            of the given view and the current OpenEngSB context as GET parameters. When an actor
            clicks on a xlink-url, the xlink-registry identifies the local tools of the Host via the
            IP of the http-request (since every connector registered itself with it´s host´s IP).
            Here lies a limitation which will be addressed in future work <link
                xlink:href="http://issues.openengsb.org/jira/browse/OPENENGSB-2777">(see on
                Jira)</link>, currently it is only possible to call this registry-url without proxy,
            since this would change the IP of the http-request. Next the xlink-registry reads the
            information from this <emphasis role="bold">sourcelink</emphasis> and provides an
                <emphasis role="bold">user-interface</emphasis> which enables the actor to
            authenticate himself and to choose a view in which he wants to open corresponding
            datapoints in his dataset. The login is done via http-authentication rather than the
            standard login page of the OpenEngSB. In the user-interface , a preselection can be made
            by filtering the tools and views to which no transformation can be done. By determining
            the tool and view the actor also defines the <emphasis role="bold"
                >destination-model</emphasis>, because every tool´s view is associated with a model.
            This user-interface is realized as <emphasis role="bold">http-servlet</emphasis>. After
            the actors selection, the given source modelobject is transformed into the
            destination-model´s structure. Next the xlink-registry calls up the connector of the
            selected tool and sends it the transformation results. Its up to the tool, how to open
            existing corresponding datapoints. As mentioned above the transformation results are
            only potential matches. It may happen that no corresponding datapoints can be found, in
            that case the actor must be informed. </para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Tools</emphasis> must be able to open the corresponding
            datapoint to a defined modelobject and to retrieve the corresponding modelobject to a
            defined datapoint. The retrieval of modelobject-links is a manually triggered action by
            the Actor. Every tool and their views must enable the actor to extract the XLink of a
            selected modelobject (see an <link
                xlink:href="#implementation.xlinkemplate.generateUsecase">example</link> how a XLink
            is created). The opening of a datapoint related to a given modelobject is an
            automatically triggered action by the registry. For example, first the actor receives a
            modelobject-link as an url via email, from a different actor, and clicks on it. He is
            forwarded to the http-servlet. Next he will be asked to define the tool and view he
            wants to open corresponding datapoints in, then the registry transforms the source
            modelobject into the destination-model´s structure and last sends the results to the
            tool, to trigger the opening of the corresponding datapoint. If no corresponding
            datapoint can be found by the tool it must inform the actor that linking failed. </para>
        <para>Note that this concept also enables the actor to <emphasis role="bold">switch

                <emphasis role="bold">two Keyfields</emphasis> that have to be used. There is also
            an event-function to Keep the list up to date. Details are explained in <link

        <title>XLink for Local Switching</title>
        <ns:para>If an actor wants to use XLink only to switch between different tools on his local
            machine, it is refeered to as <emphasis role="bold">Local Switching</emphasis>.
            According to the sequence of actions above, the actor would have to extract an XLink
            from his currently active tool, execute that XLink in a Browser and select the tool he
            wants to switch to, in the http-servlet. To make this easier, XLink offers a shortcut
            for local switching. This section describe how tools can implement this shortcut and how
            it benefits it´s actors. Note that local switching must only be supported by the
            outgoing tool, even though it may not be possible to switch back if the traget tool
            doesn´t support it.</ns:para>
        <ns:para>To increase the Usability, the tool has to be able to reduce the nessecary
            interaction by retrieving the information about other installed tools by itself. And by
            sending an http-request to the registry that directly fires the transformation without
            opening the http-servlet in a browser. The list of installed tools and the Information
            about the ConnectorId and the keyfield of the ViewId are transfered in the XLinkTemplate
            during the registration. The list of installed tools is updated with an Event Method
            (see the implementation <link xlink:href="#implementation.localswitch.information"
                >here</link>).</ns:para>
        <ns:para>To establish a http connection to the registry, an actor must authenticate.
            Therefore the tool must ask the actor to input his credentials, if required. In order to
            make XLinks useable for Local Switching they only require some extra information, so
            that they can skip the http-servlet for the actor´s input. In the http-servlet the actor
            chooses the destination tool and the destination view, since this information is now
            locally available, the tool can enable the actor to make this decision in the tool,
            without opening the browser. This information is now appended to the XLink (see an <link
                xlink:href="#implementation.localswitch.creation">example</link> how a XLink for
            Local Switching is created). If the XLink contains the ConnectorId (which represents the
            Tool) and the ViewId, the http-servlet is skipped and the transformation is started
            immediately, just a status code 200 is returned. Note that the registry may return an
            http authentication request first. In this case the tool must authenticate itself with
            the http-authentication header and the actor´s credentials before the transformation is
            started.</ns:para>
        <ns:para>Tools that support Local Switching, enable the actor to trigger the transformation
            of datapoints, without leaving the tool during selection of the destination tool. The
            process was reduced by the intermediate step of opening the browser and using the
            http-servlet. </ns:para>
        <ns:para>Since the identification of the Host is done, like in the http-servlet, via the IP,
            the same Proxy limitations appliy here <link
                xlink:href="http://issues.openengsb.org/jira/browse/OPENENGSB-2777">(see on
                Jira)</link>, because a Proxy would change the IP of the http-request.</ns:para>
