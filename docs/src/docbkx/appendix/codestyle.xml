  <title>Java Coding Style</title>

  <section>
    <title>Sun Coding Guidelines</title>
    <para>The OpenEngSB Coding Guidelines are based upon the <link
        xlink:href="http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConvTOC.doc.html">Code Conventions for the Java
        Programming Language</link>. There are some additions and deviations for this project.</para>
    <section>
      <title>Line length</title>
      <para>A line length of 80 was standard 10 years ago, but with increasing screen size and resolution a length of
        120 is more reasonable.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Wrapping</title>
      <para>Use the auto-formatter of your IDE. Import the <link
          xlink:href="http://dev.openengsb.org/resources/eclipse/formatter.xml">Eclipse Formatter file</link>.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Number of declarations per line</title>
      <para> Only one declaration per line is allowed. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Declaration placement</title>
      <para> Declare variables where they are needed. It's easier to read and restricts the scope of variables. Don't
        overshadow variables. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Blank lines</title>
      <para> The body of a method should not start with a blank line. </para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>General</title>
    <section>
      <title>File format</title>
      <para>Every Java file has to be UTF-8 encoded and has to use UNIX line endings. Indentations consist of four
        spaces, tab-stops are not allowed.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Header</title>
      <para> Every source file has to start with this header:
        <programlisting>
<![CDATA[/**

 */]]></programlisting>
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Duplication</title>
      <para>Code duplication has to be avoided at all costs.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Use guards</title>
      <para> Guards are a possibility to reduce the amount of nesting. Heavily nested code is much harder to read. Bad:
        <programlisting>
<![CDATA[public void foo() {
    if (conditionA) {
        if (conditionB) {
            if (conditionC) {
                // do some work
            }
        } else {
            throw new MyException();
        }
    }
}]]></programlisting>
        Good:
        <programlisting>
<![CDATA[public void foo() {
    if (!conditionA) {
        return;
    }

    if (!conditionB) {
        throw new MyException();
    }

    if (!conditionC) {
        return;
    }

    // do some work
}]]></programlisting>
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Keep methods short</title>
      <para>Methods longer than 40 lines are candidates for refactoring. A method should only do one thing and has to be
        easily understandable. The number of arguments should be minimized. A method should only be at a single level of
        abstraction.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Use enums</title>
      <para>Prefer typesafe enumerations over integer constants.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Avoid use of static members</title>
      <para>Static members are a sign of a design error because they are like global variables. It's fine if you declare
        a constant as final abstract of course.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Use fully qualified imports</title>
      <para>Don't import org.example.package.*, instead import the needed classes.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Never declare implementation types</title>
      <para>Use interfaces or the abstract base class instead of concrete implementation classes where possible. Don't
        write: <programlisting><![CDATA[ArrayList<String> names = new ArrayList<String>();]]></programlisting> Instead
        use the interface name:
        <programlisting><![CDATA[List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>();]]></programlisting> This is especially
        important in method signatures. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>SerialVersionUID</title>
      <para> Don't declare serialVersionUID just because your IDE tells you. Have a good reason why you need it. This
        can cause bugs that are hard to detect. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Restrict scope of suppressed warnings</title>
      <para> If you have to suppress a warning make sure you give it the smallest possible scope. This means you should
        never annotate a whole class with @SuppressWarnings. A method may be acceptable but you should try to annotate
        the problematic statements instead. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Use String.format()</title>
      <para> Use String.format() instead of long concatenation chains which are hard to read. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Array declaration style</title>
      <para> Always use <programlisting> Type[] arrayName;</programlisting> instead of the C-like
        <programlisting>Type arrayName[];</programlisting>
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Comments</title>
      <para> Don't make funny comments, be professional. All comments have to be in English. Comment what methods do,
        not how they do it. Do not comment what is already stated in code. </para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Naming</title>
    <section>
      <title>Interfaces</title>
      <para> Interfaces are not marked by starting their names with I. This exposes more information than necessary and
        is not Java-like. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Don't abbreviate</title>
      <para> Do not use abbreviations if it's not a project wide standard. Long method names are preferable to
        inconsistency. With automatic code completion this isn't a problem anyway. </para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>No clutter</title>
    <para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Exception/Log Messages have to be concise. Don't end messages with "...".</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Don't overuse FINAL, use it where you have a good reason something has to be final. Although it doesn't
            hurt to declare everything as final it clutters the code.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Don't use history tables in source files. Use the SCM system if you are interested in the changes of a
            file.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Don't use the JavaDoc author tag. Also use the SCM system.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Don't declare unnecessary constructors, especially the empty default constructor.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Don't make implicit calls explicitly, i.e. calling super(); in every constructor.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Don't specify modifiers that are implicit, i.e. don't make methods in interfaces <code>public
              abstract</code>.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Don't initialize fields with null, they are automatically initialized with null.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Don't use banners in comments.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Don't use closing brace comments, i.e. } // end if, they are a sign of too long methods.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Don't comment out code and commit it. This confuses programmers why it is there. Simply delete it, it's
            still present in the SCM history.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Exception Handling</title>
    <para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Don't log and throw. Either a exception should be logged or thrown to be processed at a more appropriate
            place.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Don't swallow exceptions silently. If you have to do it, you have to make a comment stating the
            reason.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Use runtime exceptions where possible.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Wrap exceptions in a RuntimeException if you don't want to specify the Exception in your method
            signature and you can't handle it.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Write meaningful exception message.</para>
        </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Make use of JUnit 4 features, e.g. @Test(expected = SomeException.class)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Tests should not output anything. They have to be automatically verified.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Don't catch exceptions just to fail manually. Declare the method to throw the exception.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Install a shutdown hook for test data files. This assures that they will be deleted and the project
              remains in a clean state.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Use <link xlink:href="http://code.google.com/p/mockito/">Mockito</link> for mocking.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Tests should have descriptive method names. It should be deducible what will be tested. Bad:
                <code>testError()</code>. Good: <code>invalidInMessageShouldReturnErrorResponse()</code>.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Naming Scheme</title>
      <para> The Maven profiles for running the tests are configured to filter based on the naming of the test class.
        The package layout is just a further convenience for the developer for running the tests manually. <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Unit Tests test one class/method/feature in isolation from their dependencies by using test doubles as
              replacement. They should be fast and need no special environment setup for execution.</para>
