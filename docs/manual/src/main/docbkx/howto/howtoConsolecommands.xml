  <section>
    <title>Adding new commands</title>

    <para>This section describes how to add new commands. The project is located in core/console. To add a new
      command not much is needed. For an finished example have a look at the
      class org.openengsb.core.console.OpenEngSBCommand.
      Here a short descritpion:
      <programlisting>
        import org.apache.felix.gogo.commands.Command;
        import org.apache.karaf.shell.console.OsgiCommandSupport;

        @Command(scope = "openengsb", name = "info", description = "Prints out some information")
        public class OpenEngSBCommand extends OsgiCommandSupport {

            @Override
            protected Object doExecute() throws Exception {
                System.out.println("Here is the information");
                return null;
            }
        }
      </programlisting>
      There is just one single other step which has to be done:
      Go into the core/console/src/main/resources/OSGI-INF/bluepring/shell-config.xml and add the following lines:
      <programlisting>
        <![CDATA[
        <command-bundle xmlns="http://karaf.apache.org/xmlns/shell/v1.0.0">
          <command name="openengsb/info">
            <action class="org.openengsb.core.console.OpenEngSBCommand"/>
          </command>
        </command-bundle>
      ]]>
      </programlisting>
      This will lead to following command "openengsb:info". To execute this command,
      start the OpenengSB console in a shell as described above and type in
      openengsb:info, this will print out the text "Here is the information"
    </para>
