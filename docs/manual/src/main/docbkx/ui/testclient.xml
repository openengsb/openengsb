    <title>Managing imports</title>
    <para>Imports are important so that global variables can work. If the class of the global
    variable isn't imported an error occeurs because the neccessary classes can't be loaded.
    To manage this imports there is a button in the testclient which brings you to a own site 
    where you can manage this imports. Here you can add, edit and delete them. If some error 
    occur while managing the imports, the site tells you what did go wrong.
