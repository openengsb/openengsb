      <p>
        The Open Engineering Service Bus (OpenEngSB) project provides an
        easy-to-use and easy-to-adapt platform for tool integration. It offers
        graphical workflow design between software tools and avoids repetitive
        setup tasks. In contrast to typical Enterprise Service Bus approaches
        existing workflows can easily be adapted to software changes due to the
        domain-based integration model. Thus, OpenEngSB enables transparency in
        dynamic development processes too and frees the engineers' time for
        productive work.
