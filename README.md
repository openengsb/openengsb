How to build
==========================
* Install JDK 6 or higher
  You can install either [Oracle JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or
[OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html) depending on the OS you use.
* Install [Maven 3 or higher](http://maven.apache.org/download.html)

  Be sure to follow the provided [installation instructions](http://maven.apache.org/download.html#Installation)

* configure **JAVA_HOME** and **PATH** environment variables

  make sure the JAVA_HOME environment variable points to the path of your JDK installation and that both **javac** and
  **mvn** are available in your PATH-variable

* Make sure you have at least 500MB of free space in your home-directory

  By default all external dependencies required for the build are downloaded to your home-directory
  ($HOME/.m2/repository or %HOME%\.m2\repository).
  You can configure the path of this directory as by following the
  [Maven Configuration Guide](http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-configuring-maven.html)

* Make sure that enough memory is available to maven during the build-process

  Therefore set the **MAVEN_OPTS** environment variable to *"-Xmx2048m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m"*.
* Run **mvn install** from the project's root directory

  This might take some time depending on your internet connection and hardware configuration (maybe about 30 min)

That's it. You can find the distributable zip-archive at *assembly/target/openengsb-framework-\<version\>.zip*.
It contains all binaries and third party dependencies required to run the openengsb-framework in Windows or *nix
environments.
To run the openengsb-framework distribution you need to extract the zip-archive and execute the corresponding
startup-script in the distribution's bin-directory (openengsb.bat for Windows, openengsb for *nix OS).

A distribution of the framework containing all domains and connectors that are developed and maintained by the
OpenEngSB Team, have a look at https://github.com/openengsb/openengsb.


Scripts

Scripts which help you to create projects, run the workspace and so on are stored in a separated script folder
(etc/scripts).
Its not required to use them but they may help you with your effort.
