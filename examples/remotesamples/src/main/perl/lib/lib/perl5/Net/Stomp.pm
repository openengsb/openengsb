Net::Stomp - A Streaming Text Orientated Messaging Protocol Client

  # send a message to the queue 'foo'

  $stomp->connect( { login => 'hello', passcode => 'there' } );

  $self->send_frame($frame);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to write a Stomp client. Stomp is the Streaming
Text Orientated Messaging Protocol (or the Protocol Briefly Known as
TTMP and Represented by the symbol :ttmp). It's a simple and easy to
implement protocol for working with Message Orientated Middleware from
any language. L<Net::Stomp> is useful for talking to Apache ActiveMQ,
an open source (Apache 2.0 licensed) Java Message Service 1.1 (JMS)
message broker packed with many enterprise features.

A Stomp frame consists of a command, a series of headers and a body -
see L<Net::Stomp::Frame> for more details.

For details on the protocol see L<http://stomp.codehaus.org/Protocol>.

To enable the ActiveMQ Broker for Stomp add the following to the
activemq.xml configuration:

  <connector>
      <serverTransport uri="stomp://localhost:61613"/>
  </connector>

For details on Stomp in ActiveMQ See L<http://www.activemq.org/site/stomp.html>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

The constructor creates a new object. You must pass in a hostname and
a port:

  my $stomp = Net::Stomp->new( { hostname => 'localhost', port => '61613' } );

=head2 connect

This connects to the Stomp server. You must pass in a login and
passcode.

You may pass in 'client-id', which specifies the JMS Client ID which
is used in combination to the activemqq.subscriptionName to denote a
durable subscriber.
  
  $stomp->connect( { login => 'hello', passcode => 'there' } );

=head2 send

This sends a message to a queue or topic. You must pass in a destination and a body.

  $stomp->send(
      { destination => '/queue/foo', body => 'test message' } );

To send a BytesMessage, you should set the field 'bytes_message' to 1.

=head2 disconnect

This disconnects from the Stomp server:

  $stomp->disconnect;

=head2 subscribe

This subscribes you to a queue or topic. You must pass in a destination.

The acknowledge mode defaults to 'auto', which means that frames will
be considered delivered after they have been sent to a client. The
other option is 'client', which means that messages will only be
considered delivered after the client specifically acknowledges them
with an ACK frame.

Other options:

'selector': which specifies a JMS Selector using SQL
92 syntax as specified in the JMS 1.1 specificiation. This allows a
filter to be applied to each message as part of the subscription.

'activemq.dispatchAsync': should messages be dispatched synchronously
or asynchronously from the producer thread for non-durable topics in
the broker. For fast consumers set this to false. For slow consumers
set it to true so that dispatching will not block fast consumers.

'activemq.exclusive': Would I like to be an Exclusive Consumer on a queue.

'activemq.maximumPendingMessageLimit': For Slow Consumer Handlingon
non-durable topics by dropping old messages - we can set a maximum
pending limit which once a slow consumer backs up to this high water
mark we begin to discard old messages.
 
'activemq.noLocal': Specifies whether or not locally sent messages
should be ignored for subscriptions. Set to true to filter out locally
sent messages.
 
'activemq.prefetchSize': Specifies the maximum number of pending
messages that will be dispatched to the client. Once this maximum is
reached no more messages are dispatched until the client acknowledges
a message. Set to 1 for very fair distribution of messages across
consumers where processing messages can be slow.
 
'activemq.priority': Sets the priority of the consumer so that
dispatching can be weighted in priority order.

'activemq.retroactive': For non-durable topics do you wish this
subscription to the retroactive.

'activemq.subscriptionName': For durable topic subscriptions you must
specify the same clientId on the connection and subscriberName on the
subscribe.

  $stomp->subscribe(
      {   destination             => '/queue/foo',
          'ack'                   => 'client',
          'activemq.prefetchSize' => 1
      }
  );

=head2 unsubscribe

This unsubscribes you to a queue or topic. You must pass in a destination:

  $stomp->unsubcribe({ destination => '/queue/foo' });

=head2 receive_frame

This blocks and returns you the next Stomp frame. 

  my $frame = $stomp->receive_frame;
  warn $frame->body; # do something here

The header bytes_message is 1 if the message was a BytesMessage.

=head2 can_read

This returns whether a frame is waiting to be read. Optionally takes a
timeout in seconds:

  my $can_read = $stomp->can_read;
  my $can_read = $stomp->can_read({ timeout => '0.1' });


=head2 ack

This acknowledges that you have received and processed a frame (if you
are using client acknowledgements):

  $stomp->ack( { frame => $frame } );

=head2 send_frame

If this module does not provide enough help for sending frames, you
may construct your own frame and send it:

  # write your own frame
  my $frame = Net::Stomp::Frame->new(
       { command => $command, headers => $conf, body => $body } );
  $self->send_frame($frame);
